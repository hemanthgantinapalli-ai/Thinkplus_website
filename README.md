## 🎨 UI/UX & Creative Decisions

The design choices were made to reflect the professionalism and engagement levels expected from a top EdTech brand:

* **Color Palette:** Use of a bold **Primary Blue (`#003366`)** for trust and corporate identity, contrasted with a **Vibrant Orange (`#FFA500`)** as an accent for calls-to-action and critical information.
* **Visual Depth:** Cards and feature boxes utilize subtle **box-shadows** and **hover states** (`transform: translateY(-8px);`) to give the interface a premium, polished feel.
* **Navigation:** Clean header navigation with full responsiveness, including a functional **mobile hamburger menu** built with JavaScript.
